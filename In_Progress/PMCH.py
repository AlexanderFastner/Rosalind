#Given: An RNA string s of length at most 80 bp having the same number of occurrences of 'A' as 'U' and the same number of occurrences of 'C' as 'G'.
#Return: The total possible number of perfect matchings of basepair edges in the bonding graph of s
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
s = "AGCUAGUCAU"
#perfect_matches = (2n−1)(2n−3)(2n−5)⋯(3)(1)
perfect_matches = 0

#calculate all sets of matches -> construct each perfect match, count
#figure out how they got 12
