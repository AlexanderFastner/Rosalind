#Given: Two positive integers k(k≤7) and N(N≤2k). 
#In this problem, we begin with Tom, who in the 0th generation has genotype Aa Bb. 
#Tom has two children in the 1st generation, each of whom has two children, and so on. 
#Each organism always mates with an organism having genotype Aa Bb.

#Return: The probability that at least N Aa Bb organisms will belong to the k-th generation of Tom's family tree 
#(don't count the Aa Bb mates at each level). Assume that Mendel's second law holds for the factors.

#Inputs
k = 2
N = 1
out = 0
